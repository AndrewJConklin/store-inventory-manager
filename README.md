# Store Inventory Manager

Please see the deployed link at https://andrewjconklin.github.io/store-inventory-manager/.

This site is an inventory management system for team Gilded Rose. All items have a `sell_in` value which denotes the number of days we have left to sell the item and a `quality` value which denotes how valuable the item is. The system takes into consideration exception criteria about the items and calulates the current quality of the item.
